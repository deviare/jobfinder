# jobfinder

This script scarp linkedin jobs offerts with Selenium,
then crawl each company sites looking for emails address using regex and save data in the database.
Optionaly can send mail to apply to the job, must provide credentials for smtp server, body text, and attachement (Curriculum) 

The program assume you have firefox and geckodriver installed respectively in /usr/bin/firefox-esr and /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
and you are using a *nix system 

The program is build to run with a linkedin account with italian lenguage.

Many things can go wrong with linkedin and Selenium, I will try to keep it updated
If you have problem during login, try to run it not headless (-H) possibly linkedin have reconize Selenium and ask for a captcha,
solve it and run it again.
